## About Me

I am a Computer Science undergraduate with a strong interest in backend development and system-level thinking.  
I focus on building projects to understand how real-world systems work, rather than just learning concepts in isolation.

My approach is simple: understand the problem deeply, design clearly, then write clean and maintainable code.

## Selected Projects

### DistributedVision-Kafka  
A Kafka-based distributed image processing pipeline.

- Implemented a Client–Master–Worker architecture
- Used asynchronous message passing for task distribution
- Gained hands-on experience with event-driven systems and coordination

### Counselling Management System  
A full-stack academic workflow simulation.

- Manages student data, results, and seat allocation logic
- Designed backend logic to reflect real counselling processes
- Focused on clarity, correctness, and structured data handling

### MindMap  
A visual concept-structuring tool.

- Helps break down complex academic topics into structured representations
- Built to improve conceptual clarity and learning efficiency

## How I Work

- Start by understanding real-world constraints
- Design data flow and structure before writing code
- Prioritize readability and correctness
- Optimize only when necessary
- Refactor until the solution feels simple
